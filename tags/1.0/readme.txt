== Description ==

This plugin is ONLY for theme developers or people wanting to play around with their theme to get their images displaying in a jQuery gallery or slider script of their choice. You won't find an options page with lots of fancy jQuery effects like colorbox or masonry here. That's the point. If you want to control which jQuery script you use to style your gallery, that other stuff just gets in the way.

This simple plugin gives you the ability to add images from your media library to galleries that you create, and order the images in each gallery with an easy drag-and-drop interface. You can also update the titles, captions and other meta info of the images in your gallery in one bulk action. Then you can use a shortcode to show your galleries in any page, post or text widget. You can also call the gallery directly from a theme file.

Lastly, and most importantly, you can customise the markup and variables that will be outputted with the gallery so you get exactly what you need for your jQuery script to work. (Adding the jQuery is up to you because it should be done inside your theme.)

**Please note: To use this plugin you should be familiar with basic html &amp; how to add jQuery to a theme. See the WordPress Codex for help.

Oh and by the way, there are no separate database tables, uploads folders, or media uploader. We're using the WordPress Media menu and adding the extra functionality we need. This means all your images are accessible to posts, pages and widgets as well as your galleries.

FEATURES
*  Uses the WordPress media uploader and library, so no confusing double-ups. 
*  Unlike many gallery plugins, your images are also available to posts, pages and widgets because they come from the Media Library. 
*  Easily add new galleries with familiar WordPress screens. 
*  Assign images to your galleries with a bulk action. 
*  Each gallery you create has a submenu in the Media menu, with easy drag and drop imaging ordering. 
*  Update titles, captions and other image meta for all the images in a gallery with a bulk action and save time. 
*  Paste a shortcode into any post, page or text widget to insert your gallery, or use a template function call. 
*  Output your own gallery markup to work with your jQuery script. 
*  Help tabs on gallery screens. 

BENEFITS
*  Lets you integrate any jQuery script with your WordPress images.
*  Makes the Media menu useful again.
